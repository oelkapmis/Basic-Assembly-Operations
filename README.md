# Basic-Assembly-Operations
Some basic MOV and ADD operations

Examples:
1. Write an Intel x86 assembly code that will write 34h value to 0100:1000h and 0100:2000h
memory addresses.
2. Write an Intel x86 assembly code that will swap the values of CL and DL registers.
3. Write an Intel x86 assembly code that will add 98h value written on 0100:0500h memory address
with 52h value written on 0100:0501h memory address, than write the result to 0100:0502h
memory address.
